# Contributing  
The intent of this project is to initiate with a in-depth project based on OpenCV and Python on [GitAll](https://gitall.tech)  

You can contribute in numerous ways in realising that goal. You'll be given recognition for your respective contributions.

## Types of Contrbutions  
### Bug Report  
The easiest way to contribute is find bugs in the projects. We'd want this to be a good project, won't we?  

### Suggestions  
Second easiest way for you to contribute is suggest us things that we can do with this. 
Keeping in mind that this is part of a tutorial project for people who're starting off with the field of CV.  

You can create Issue regarding your suggestions. I'll get on it as soon as I can.

### Code  
The most awesome contribution would be with code.  

You can always clone this project and add your contributions in the code.  

These could be,
* commenting the code for readibility,
* correcting/optimizing the code,
* adding different versions of the project in different languages
* adding to the current features  

Everything's welcome and appreciated.  

NOTE: As this is a project for GitAll, it'd mean a lot if you could write the documentation to your contributions as well
