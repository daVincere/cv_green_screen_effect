# Project Thanos

Green Screens and Blue Screens are used extensively for VFX Purposes in movies and tv shows.

In this project we wish to get similar or somewhere similar results using OpenCV and Python

## ELI5

We'll try to replace a background in live video, or video, or image with something of our own choosing.

Something like this from Lord of the Rings

or this from Game of Thrones, when Yegritte is about to fall off the wall.

## Prequisites

Basic knowledge of Python is a plus.
Misc

## Two declarations:

1. I only have a very faint idea as to how it's going to be done. so I'll improvise a lot during the project.

2. Each new update would be released on a Saturday, starting the upcoming one!

Stay tuned!
